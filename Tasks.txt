verifact-hash assumes you have only one register per folder

for capture_*.zip, read its SHA512 paliatively from line 100, and SHA3-512 from line 101
and metadata_*.zip SHA512 from line 105, and SHA3-512 from line 106
when reading a line, exclude "HASH SHA512: " or "HASH SHA3-512: ", so having a pure hash to digest

for matching with verifact-hash.sh lecture, exclude "  capture_*.zip" from the SHA512 and exclude "SHA3-512(capture_*.zip)= " from the SHA3-512

then, .verifacthash will finalize with text confirming if each hash match or not (with an emoji simbolizing as prefix icon!)

mirror FilePeace's folderstamp at detecting existing ".verifacthash" and renaming it as ".verifacthash1" then adding ".verifacthash2" substantively
